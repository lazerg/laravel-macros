# A set of useful Laravel macros

This repository contains some useful macros.

## Installation

You can pull in the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require lazerg/laravel-macros
```

The package will automatically register itself.

It is advised to be used with [Laravel IDE Helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper), which generates helper files for your IDE, so it'll be able to highlight and understand some Laravel-specific syntax.
This package provides an additional IDE helper file for Laravel macros with the syntax you are already used to in Laravel IDE Helper.
